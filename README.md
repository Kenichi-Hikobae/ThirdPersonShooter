Third Person Shooter Demo
--------------------------------------------------------
Unity Project about a third person shooter demo with the basic setup of the mechanics involved in a shooter, such as: aiming system, weapon switching, reloading system, weapons animations, enemy AI, ragdoll physics, damage system and character physics and movement.
--------------------------------------------------------
The project has a single scene where we will find different obstacles and the main character with all the settings to play. When running the project you have to choose how many enemies you want in the scene with a maximum of 50 an press play.

The different actions that the player can perform are: equip and unequip a weapon, shoot, reload the weapon, run, jump and aim with the different weapons.

Weapons have different vertical and horizontal recoil properties as well as different animations for each action performed by the player. In addition, each weapon has an added firing effect when hitting static objects, as well as a bullet effect.

Enemies behave as if they were zombies, at the beginning of the scene if they have not seen the player they will move randomly to a randomly close position, if the player enters the vision range of any enemy or the player shoots an enemy, the enemy will chase him around the scene.

When an enemy dies the ragdoll physics are activated, and the player can shoot at them to move them. I hope it was clear, if you have any questions about the project you can contact me to know more about it.

In the project you will find different useful things like the aiming systems of each weapon, the ragdoll physics, the shooting effects and the diferentes features of aiming and damage. The project also has a .FBX file of a manequi modeled and rigged in blender, as well as its different animations, and also the different weapons used also made in blender.
